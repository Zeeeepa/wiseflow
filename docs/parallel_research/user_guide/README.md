## Introduction

WiseFlow's parallel research capabilities allow you to extract information from various sources using Large Language Models (LLMs) in a concurrent and efficient manner. The system supports multiple research modes and parallel processing to handle large-scale information extraction and analysis tasks.

### Key Features

- **Multiple Research Modes**: Choose from linear, graph-based, or multi-agent research modes based on your needs.
- **Parallel Processing**: Configure the number of parallel workers to optimize performance.
- **Multiple Search APIs**: Integrate with various search APIs including Tavily, Perplexity, Exa, ArXiv, PubMed, and more.
- **Task Monitoring**: Monitor the progress and status of research tasks in real-time.
- **Result Visualization**: Visualize research results through knowledge graphs and other visualization tools.
- **Template System**: Save and reuse research configurations as templates.

### User Interface

The WiseFlow dashboard provides a user-friendly interface for configuring, executing, and monitoring parallel research tasks. The main components of the interface include:

- **Research Configuration Panel**: Configure research parameters including topic, mode, and parallel workers.
- **Task Monitoring Panel**: Monitor the progress and status of research tasks.
- **Results Panel**: View and explore research results.
- **Templates Panel**: Save and load research configuration templates.

## Getting Started

To get started with parallel research in WiseFlow, see the [Quick Start Guide](./quick_start.md).

## Research Modes

WiseFlow supports three research modes:

1. **Linear Mode**: A simple sequential research process that follows a straightforward path from query to results.

2. **Graph-based Mode**: An iterative research approach with reflection and refinement, allowing for deeper exploration of topics.

3. **Multi-agent Mode**: A collaborative research approach using specialized agents that work in parallel on different aspects of the research topic.

For more information about research modes, see the [Research Modes](./research_modes.md) guide.

## Parallel Processing

WiseFlow implements parallel processing through configurable parallel workers. You can adjust the number of parallel workers for different data sources to optimize performance based on your system resources and research requirements.

For more information about configuring parallel workers, see the [Configuring Parallel Workers](./configuring_parallel_workers.md) guide.

## Search APIs

WiseFlow integrates with various search APIs to gather information for research. You can configure which search API to use based on your research topic and requirements.

For more information about search APIs, see the [Search APIs](./search_apis.md) guide.

## Best Practices

To get the most out of WiseFlow's parallel research capabilities, follow these best practices:

- **Choose the Right Research Mode**: Select the research mode based on your research requirements.
- **Optimize Parallel Workers**: Configure the number of parallel workers based on your system resources.
- **Use Templates**: Save and reuse research configurations as templates for similar research tasks.
- **Monitor Tasks**: Keep an eye on task progress and resource usage during research.
- **Review Results**: Carefully review research results and refine your research parameters as needed.

For more detailed best practices, see the [Best Practices](./best_practices.md) guide.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with parallel research in WiseFlow, see the [Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.md) guide for common problems and solutions.

# WiseFlow Performance Optimizations

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented in WiseFlow to improve efficiency and reduce resource usage.

## Overview

The performance optimizations focus on several key areas:

1. Memory management
2. Database operations
3. Thread pool management
4. LLM integration
5. Resource monitoring

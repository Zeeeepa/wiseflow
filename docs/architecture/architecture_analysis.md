# WiseFlow Architecture Analysis

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the WiseFlow system architecture, identifying current architectural patterns, issues, and recommendations for improvement.

## 2. System Overview

WiseFlow is a system designed to extract and analyze information from various sources using Large Language Models (LLMs). The system helps users focus on what matters by filtering through massive amounts of information from different sources.

### 2.1 Key Components

The WiseFlow architecture consists of several key components:

1. **Core Module**: Handles information extraction, analysis, and processing
   - Information extraction from various sources
   - Analysis using LLMs
   - Knowledge graph construction
   - Entity extraction and linking

2. **Dashboard**: Provides a web-based user interface
   - Search interface
   - Visualization of analysis results
   - Configuration management
   - Task monitoring

3. **Plugin System**: Enables extensibility through custom plugins
   - Connectors for different data sources
   - Processors for different content types
   - Analyzers for specialized analysis tasks

4. **Event System**: Facilitates communication between components
   - Event publication and subscription
   - Asynchronous communication
   - Decoupling of components

5. **Task Management**: Manages concurrent processing of tasks
   - Task scheduling and execution
   - Dependency management
   - Resource monitoring and optimization

6. **Configuration System**: Handles settings and environment variables
   - Environment-based configuration
   - Validation of configuration values
   - Secure storage of sensitive information

### 2.2 External Dependencies

The system integrates with several external technologies:

- **FastAPI**: For API endpoints and web server
- **PocketBase**: For database operations and storage
- **LLM Services**: OpenAI, LiteLLM for language model integration
- **Web Crawling**: Playwright, BeautifulSoup for data collection
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn for data analysis
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization

## 3. Current Architectural Patterns

WiseFlow employs multiple architectural patterns:

### 3.1 Plugin Architecture

The system uses a plugin architecture to enable extensibility without modifying core code:

- **Plugin Manager**: Loads and manages plugins
- **Plugin Types**: Connectors, Processors, Analyzers
- **Plugin Lifecycle**: Loading, initialization, execution, shutdown

### 3.2 Event-Driven Architecture

The system uses an event-driven architecture for loose coupling between components:

- **Event Bus**: Central event publication and subscription
- **Event Types**: System, Task, Data, Connector events
- **Event Handlers**: Asynchronous event processing

### 3.3 Task-Based Concurrency

The system uses a task-based concurrency model for parallel processing:

- **Task Manager**: Schedules and executes tasks
- **Task Dependencies**: Tasks can depend on other tasks
- **Resource Monitoring**: Adjusts concurrency based on resource usage

### 3.4 API-First Design

The system uses an API-first design for integration capabilities:

- **REST API**: For external integration
- **WebSocket API**: For real-time updates
- **API Authentication**: For secure access

## 4. Architectural Issues

### 4.1 Separation of Concerns

**Issues:**

- **Mixed Responsibilities**: Several modules handle multiple concerns
  - `run_task.py` mixes task scheduling, resource monitoring, and business logic
  - Dashboard backend mixes UI rendering and data processing
  - `general_process.py` likely handles too many responsibilities

- **Lack of Clear Boundaries**: No clear boundaries between components
  - Core module has dependencies on dashboard
  - Plugin system is tightly coupled with core module
  - Event system is used inconsistently

- **Monolithic Structure**: Some components are too large and complex
  - Core module contains too many submodules
  - Task management is spread across multiple files
  - Configuration is handled in multiple places

**Impact:**

- Difficult to maintain and extend
- Challenging to test individual components
- Higher risk of introducing bugs when modifying code
- Limited reusability of components

### 4.2 Dependency Management

**Issues:**

- **Numerous External Dependencies**: The system depends on many external libraries
  - Requirements files list dozens of dependencies
  - Some dependencies have specific version constraints
  - Potential for dependency conflicts

- **No Dependency Injection**: Dependencies are imported directly
  - Hard-coded imports create tight coupling
  - Difficult to mock dependencies for testing
  - Limited flexibility in component implementation

- **Implicit Dependencies**: Some dependencies are not clearly documented
  - Components assume the availability of certain services
  - No clear dependency graph
  - Hidden dependencies create maintenance challenges

**Impact:**

- Difficult to update dependencies
- Potential for "dependency hell"
- Challenging to mock dependencies for testing
- Limited flexibility in component implementation

### 4.3 Component Coupling

**Issues:**

- **Direct Imports**: Components import each other directly
  - Core imports dashboard components
  - Dashboard imports core components
  - Plugins import core components

- **Shared State**: Components share mutable state
  - Global configuration
  - Shared database access
  - Singleton instances

- **Implicit Contracts**: No clear interfaces between components
  - Components assume specific behavior from others
  - Changes in one component can break others
  - No formal contracts or interfaces

**Impact:**

- Changes in one component can break others
- Difficult to replace or upgrade individual components
- Limited reusability of components
- Challenging to test components in isolation

### 4.4 Error Handling

**Issues:**

- **Inconsistent Patterns**: Error handling is inconsistent across the codebase
  - Some errors are caught and logged
  - Others are propagated
  - Some are silently ignored

- **No Centralized Error Management**: No central error handling strategy
  - Error handling is ad-hoc
  - No consistent error categorization
  - Limited error recovery mechanisms

- **Limited Resilience**: The system has limited resilience to failures
  - External service failures can cascade
  - No circuit breakers or fallback mechanisms
  - Limited retry logic

**Impact:**

- Unpredictable behavior during failures
- Difficult to diagnose issues
- Potential for unhandled exceptions
- Limited resilience to external service failures

### 4.5 State Management

**Issues:**

  - Shared database access
  - Singleton instances

- **Potential Race Conditions**: Concurrent operations can lead to race conditions
  - Multiple tasks accessing shared resources
  - Limited locking mechanisms
  - Inconsistent state management

  - Some state is managed through events
  - Some through direct updates
  - Some through database operations

**Impact:**

- Difficult to reason about system state
- Potential for data inconsistencies
- Challenging to debug state-related issues
- Limited scalability

### 4.6 Configuration Management

**Issues:**

- **Complex Configuration System**: Configuration is complex and spread across multiple sources
  - Environment variables
  - Configuration files
  - Database settings

- **Limited Validation**: Not all configuration values are validated
  - Some validation in `config.py`
  - Other values used without validation
  - Potential for misconfiguration

- **Configuration Spread**: Configuration is handled in multiple places
  - Core configuration
  - Dashboard configuration
  - Plugin configuration

**Impact:**

- Difficult to understand available configuration options
- Potential for misconfiguration
- Challenging to maintain configuration consistency
- Limited visibility into configuration state

# WiseFlow Architecture Improvements

This directory contains documentation and sample implementations for the WiseFlow architecture improvements.

## Overview

The WiseFlow architecture has been analyzed and improved to address several issues:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Improved separation between different components and layers
2. **Dependency Management**: Implemented dependency injection for better management of dependencies
3. **Component Coupling**: Reduced coupling between components through interfaces and events
4. **Error Handling**: Standardized error handling patterns
5. **State Management**: Improved state management with clear boundaries
6. **Configuration Management**: Centralized configuration with validation

## Documentation

- [Architecture Analysis](architecture_analysis.md): Detailed analysis of the current architecture and identified issues
- [Current Architecture](current_architecture.md): Documentation of the current architecture
- [Proposed Architecture](proposed_architecture.md): Documentation of the proposed improved architecture
- [Refactoring Plan](refactoring_plan.md): Detailed plan for implementing the architectural improvements

## Sample Implementations

The following sample implementations demonstrate the improved architecture:

### Core Infrastructure

- **Dependency Injection**: `core/di_container.py` - A dependency injection container for managing service dependencies
- **Configuration Service**: `core/infrastructure/config/configuration_service.py` - A centralized configuration service

### Domain Layer

- **Domain Models**: `core/domain/models/information.py` - Domain models for information extraction and processing
- **Domain Services**: `core/domain/services/information_service.py` - Domain service interfaces and implementations
- **Repositories**: `core/domain/repositories/information_repository.py` - Repository interfaces for data access

### Application Layer

- **Application Services**: `core/application/services/information_processing_service.py` - Application services for orchestrating use cases

### Infrastructure Layer

- **Service Implementations**: `core/infrastructure/services/openai_llm_service.py` - Implementations of domain service interfaces
- **Repository Implementations**: `core/infrastructure/repositories/pocketbase_information_repository.py` - Implementations of repository interfaces
- **Service Registration**: `core/infrastructure/di/service_registration.py` - Registration of services with the dependency injection container

### API Layer

- **API Controllers**: `core/api/controllers/information_controller.py` - API controllers for handling HTTP requests
- **API Setup**: `core/api/main.py` - Setup of the FastAPI application with dependency injection

## Implementation Status

The sample implementations provided here demonstrate the improved architecture but are not yet fully integrated with the existing codebase. The next steps are:

1. Complete the implementation of all components according to the refactoring plan
2. Integrate the new components with the existing codebase
3. Migrate functionality from the old architecture to the new one
4. Test the new architecture thoroughly
5. Document the new architecture and its components

## Benefits of the New Architecture

The improved architecture provides several benefits:

1. **Maintainability**: Clearer separation of concerns makes the codebase easier to maintain
2. **Testability**: Dependency injection and interfaces make components easier to test
3. **Flexibility**: Reduced coupling allows components to be replaced or upgraded independently
4. **Scalability**: Better state management and concurrency control improve scalability
5. **Reliability**: Standardized error handling improves reliability
6. **Extensibility**: Plugin architecture and clear interfaces make the system easier to extend

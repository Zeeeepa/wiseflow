# Phase 4: Refinement - UI Mockups

This document provides detailed UI mockup descriptions for the Refinement phase of the Wiseflow upgrade plan.

## System Monitor

The System Monitor provides a comprehensive view of system performance, resource usage, and health metrics.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time performance monitoring
- Resource usage visualization
- Component health status
- Error and warning tracking
- Performance optimization recommendations
- Historical performance analysis

**UI Elements:**
- Performance dashboard with key metrics
- Resource usage charts (CPU, memory, storage, network)
- Component status indicators
- Error and warning logs
- Performance trend analysis
- Optimization recommendation cards
- Configuration management interface

**Mockup Description:**
The System Monitor features a dashboard-style interface with real-time metrics displayed in gauges, charts, and status indicators. At the top, a summary panel shows overall system health with color-coded status for different components (data connectors, processing pipeline, storage, API, etc.). Below, a resource usage section displays charts for CPU, memory, storage, and network utilization with historical trends. A component health section provides detailed status for each system component with uptime, response time, error rate, and throughput metrics. An issues panel lists recent errors and warnings with severity, timestamp, and resolution status. The performance analysis section shows trends over time and identifies potential bottlenecks. A recommendations panel suggests configuration changes and optimizations based on usage patterns. The interface includes tools for adjusting system configuration, scaling resources, and scheduling maintenance tasks.

## User Preferences

The User Preferences interface allows users to customize their experience, manage settings, and configure personal preferences.

**Key Features:**
- Interface customization options
- Notification preferences
- Default view settings
- Language and localization
- Accessibility options
- Privacy and data sharing settings
- API key management

**UI Elements:**
- Settings categories navigation
- Preference configuration forms
- Theme and layout customization
- Notification channel management
- Language and region selectors
- Accessibility controls
- Privacy and sharing toggles
- API key generation and management

**Mockup Description:**
The User Preferences interface features a clean, organized layout with settings categories in a sidebar navigation. The main content area displays the selected category's settings with intuitive controls (toggles, dropdowns, sliders, etc.). The Interface section allows customizing themes (light/dark/custom), layout density, default views, and widget arrangements. The Notifications section provides controls for which events trigger notifications and how they're delivered (in-app, email, external systems). The Language & Region section offers language selection, date/time format preferences, and unit system choices. The Accessibility section includes options for font size, contrast, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility. The Privacy section allows controlling what data is collected, stored, and shared. The API Access section provides tools for generating and managing API keys with permission scopes. Each section includes a "Reset to Defaults" option and contextual help tooltips.

## Export and Integration Interface

The Export and Integration Interface provides tools for exporting data and insights, as well as integrating with external systems.

**Key Features:**
- Export to various formats (PDF, CSV, JSON, etc.)
- API endpoint documentation and testing
- Webhook configuration
- Integration with external systems
- Scheduled export jobs
- Export history and management
- Custom export templates

**UI Elements:**
- Export format selector
- Content selection interface
- API documentation browser
- Webhook configuration form
- Integration connector cards
- Export job scheduler
- Export history and status
- Template management tools

**Mockup Description:**
The Export and Integration Interface features a task-oriented design with separate sections for different operations. The Export section provides a wizard-like interface for selecting content (data sources, entities, insights), format (PDF, CSV, JSON, etc.), and options (filters, fields, styling). The API section offers interactive documentation for all API endpoints with request builders, response examples, and authentication tools. The Webhooks section allows configuring event-triggered HTTP callbacks to external systems with payload customization. The Integrations section displays cards for available external system connectors (Slack, Teams, CRM systems, etc.) with setup wizards and status indicators. The Scheduled Exports section provides a calendar interface for setting up recurring export jobs with destination options. The History section lists all past exports with status, timestamp, and download links. The Templates section allows saving and managing custom export configurations for reuse.

## Documentation Portal

The Documentation Portal provides comprehensive documentation for users, administrators, and developers.

**Key Features:**
- User guides with tutorials and walkthroughs
- Administrator documentation
- API reference documentation
- Developer guides
- Deployment and configuration guides
- Troubleshooting and FAQ sections
- Community contributions and examples

**UI Elements:**
- Documentation navigation tree
- Search functionality with filters
- Interactive code examples
- Step-by-step tutorials
- Video demonstrations
- Feedback and rating system
- Version selector for documentation

**Mockup Description:**
The Documentation Portal features a modern documentation site layout with a navigation sidebar, search bar, and main content area. The navigation is organized by user role (End User, Administrator, Developer) and then by topic. The search functionality supports filters by role, topic, and content type with instant results as you type. The main content area displays documentation with rich formatting, interactive examples, screenshots, and embedded videos. For API documentation, interactive request builders allow testing endpoints directly from the documentation. Step-by-step tutorials include progress tracking and checkmarks for completed steps. Each page includes a feedback section where users can rate helpfulness and leave comments. A version selector allows viewing documentation for different software versions. The portal also includes a community section where users can share examples, use cases, and extensions.

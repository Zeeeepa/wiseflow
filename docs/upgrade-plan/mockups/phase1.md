**Mockup Description:**
The Plugin Management interface features a clean, modern design with a sidebar navigation menu on the left. The main content area displays installed plugins in a card-based layout, with each card showing the plugin name, version, status, and quick action buttons. A search bar at the top allows filtering plugins by name or type. The "Add New Plugin" button opens the plugin marketplace, which displays available plugins with descriptions and ratings. Clicking on a plugin card opens a detailed view with configuration options and documentation.

## Data Source Configuration Interface

The Data Source Configuration interface allows users to set up and manage connections to various data sources.

- Schedule configuration with visual calendar
- Test connection button and validation feedback
- Advanced settings panel for fine-tuning

**Mockup Description:**
The Data Source Configuration interface presents a step-by-step wizard for setting up new data sources. The first step involves selecting the source type (web, academic, GitHub, etc.). The second step collects authentication details with appropriate form fields based on the selected source type. The third step allows configuring crawling frequency and scope using intuitive controls like sliders and toggles. The final step provides a summary and test connection option. For existing connections, a table view lists all configured sources with status indicators and action buttons for edit, pause, and delete operations.

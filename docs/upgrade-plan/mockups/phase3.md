# Phase 3: Intelligence - UI Mockups

This document provides detailed UI mockup descriptions for the Intelligence phase of the Wiseflow upgrade plan.

## Insight Dashboard

The Insight Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of patterns, trends, and insights discovered across all data sources.

**Key Features:**
- Pattern recognition visualization
- Anomaly detection and highlighting
- Temporal analysis of trends
- Cross-source correlation discovery
- Automated insight generation
- Custom insight creation and sharing

**UI Elements:**
- Overview dashboard with key insights
- Pattern visualization cards
- Anomaly detection alerts
- Trend charts and timelines
- Correlation matrix
- Insight creation wizard
- Insight sharing and export tools

**Mockup Description:**
The Insight Dashboard features a modular, card-based layout that can be customized by the user. At the top, a summary section displays the most significant insights discovered recently, with severity/importance indicators. Below, the main dashboard area contains various insight cards organized by category (patterns, anomalies, trends, correlations). Each card provides a visual representation of the insight (chart, graph, etc.) and a concise description. Clicking on a card expands it to show more details, source information, and related insights. A sidebar provides filters for time range, data sources, entity types, and insight categories. The dashboard includes an "Insight Wizard" button that guides users through creating custom insights by selecting data sources, entities, time periods, and analysis types. Users can save, share, and export insights in various formats.

## Predictive Analytics Interface

The Predictive Analytics Interface provides tools for forecasting trends, analyzing potential impacts, and generating recommendations based on historical data.

**Key Features:**
- Trend forecasting with confidence intervals
- Impact analysis for hypothetical scenarios
- Recommendation generation
- Scenario modeling and comparison
- Model performance monitoring
- Forecast accuracy tracking

**UI Elements:**
- Forecast visualization with confidence bands
- Scenario builder interface
- Impact analysis dashboard
- Recommendation cards
- Model selection and configuration panel
- Accuracy metrics and validation tools

**Mockup Description:**
The Predictive Analytics Interface features a forecast-centric design with a large visualization area showing predicted trends with confidence intervals. A control panel on the left allows selecting entities, metrics, and time horizons for forecasting. Below the main visualization, a scenario builder interface enables users to create "what-if" scenarios by adjusting parameters and comparing multiple potential futures. The impact analysis section displays how changes in one metric might affect others, with sensitivity indicators. A recommendation panel suggests actions based on forecasts and impact analyses, with each recommendation showing expected outcomes and confidence levels. The interface includes tools for evaluating model performance, comparing different forecasting approaches, and tracking prediction accuracy over time. Users can save scenarios, export forecasts, and share insights with team members.

## Main Dashboard

The Main Dashboard provides a unified view of all data, insights, and system status in a customizable interface.

**Key Features:**
- Customizable widget-based layout
- Cross-source search and filtering
- Real-time data visualization
- System status monitoring
- User activity tracking
- Saved views and preferences

**UI Elements:**
- Widget library with drag-and-drop interface
- Global search bar with advanced filters
- Data visualization components
- System status indicators
- User activity timeline
- View management tools
- Export and sharing options

**Mockup Description:**
The Main Dashboard features a highly customizable interface with a grid-based layout for widgets. A widget library on the left provides various components that can be dragged onto the dashboard: data visualizations, search results, entity profiles, system metrics, etc. A global search bar at the top allows searching across all data sources with advanced filtering options. Each widget can be resized, moved, configured, and saved as part of a dashboard view. The interface includes a view selector for switching between different dashboard configurations (e.g., "Research Overview," "Trend Analysis," "System Monitoring"). A system status section shows the health of all components, data freshness, and processing queue status. User activity is tracked in a timeline that can be expanded to show recent searches, viewed entities, and generated insights. The dashboard supports exporting views as reports, sharing links to specific configurations, and setting up scheduled exports.

## Notification Center

The Notification Center provides a centralized interface for managing alerts, updates, and notifications about new information and insights.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time alerts for new relevant information
- Digest generation for periodic updates
- Notification prioritization and categorization
- Customizable notification preferences
- Integration with external systems
- Notification history and archiving

**UI Elements:**
- Notification feed with filtering options
- Alert detail view with context and actions
- Digest configuration interface
- Preference management panel
- Integration settings for external systems
- Notification history and search

**Mockup Description:**
The Notification Center features a feed-based design with notifications displayed in chronological order, with the most recent at the top. Each notification includes a title, brief description, source, timestamp, and priority indicator. Filters on the left allow sorting and filtering notifications by type, source, priority, and read/unread status. Clicking on a notification expands it to show full details, context, and suggested actions. The interface includes a "Digest Settings" section where users can configure periodic summaries (daily, weekly, etc.) with custom content preferences. A "Notification Preferences" panel allows fine-grained control over which events trigger notifications and how they are delivered (in-app, email, external systems). The integration settings enable connecting the notification system to external tools like Slack, Microsoft Teams, or email. A search function allows finding specific notifications in the history, and archiving options help manage notification volume.

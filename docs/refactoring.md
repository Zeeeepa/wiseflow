# WiseFlow Codebase Refactoring

## Overview

This document describes the refactoring process for the WiseFlow codebase to remove unused code, consolidate duplicated functionality, and improve code organization.

## Identified Issues

### 1. Unused Code

- **run_task_new.py**: An alternative implementation of run_task.py that was not referenced anywhere in the codebase
- **ResearchConnector class**: Only used in examples, not in the main codebase
- **Unused methods** in thread_pool_manager.py and task_manager.py
- **Numerous unused imports** across multiple files

### 2. Duplicated Functionality

- **task_manager.py and thread_pool_manager.py**: 27.94% code duplication
- **export_example.py and export_infos.py**: 58.27% code duplication
- **Parallel implementations**: run_task.py and run_task_new.py implement similar functionality

### 3. Syntax Errors

- Syntax errors in run_task.py related to positional arguments following keyword arguments

## Refactoring Process

### Phase 1: Clean Up Unused Imports and Fix Syntax Errors

1. Removed unused imports from:
   - research_connector.py
   - run_task_new.py
   - task_manager.py
   - thread_pool_manager.py
   - run_task.py

2. Fixed syntax errors in run_task.py

### Phase 2: Consolidate Duplicated Export Functionality

1. Created a unified export module (export_utils.py) that combines functionality from:
   - export_example.py
   - export_infos.py

2. Added comprehensive tests for the new module (test_export_utils.py)

3. Key improvements:
   - Unified interface for CSV and Excel exports
   - Consistent error handling
   - Better type annotations
   - Improved documentation
   - Comprehensive test coverage

### Phase 3: Consolidate Task Management

1. Created a unified task management module (unified_task_manager.py) that combines functionality from:
   - task_manager.py
   - thread_pool_manager.py

2. Added comprehensive tests for the new module (test_unified_task_manager.py)

3. Key improvements:
   - Support for both synchronous and asynchronous tasks
   - Unified interface for task management
   - Better dependency handling
   - Improved error handling
   - Comprehensive test coverage
   - Backward compatibility through aliases

### Phase 4: Address Parallel Implementations

1. Analyzed run_task.py and run_task_new.py
2. Determined that run_task.py is the primary implementation based on usage in the codebase
3. Removed run_task_new.py as it was unused

### Phase 5: Clean Up Research Connector

1. Evaluated ResearchConnector usage
2. Kept the class but removed unused imports
3. Improved documentation

## Backward Compatibility

To maintain backward compatibility, the following measures were taken:

1. **Task Management**:
   - The unified_task_manager.py module provides aliases for TaskManager and thread_pool_manager
   - The API is compatible with both previous implementations

2. **Export Functionality**:
   - The export_utils.py module provides all functionality from both previous implementations
   - Function signatures are compatible with previous usage

3. **Research Connector**:
   - The ResearchConnector class was kept but cleaned up
   - The API remains unchanged

## Testing

Comprehensive tests were added for all new modules:

1. **test_export_utils.py**: Tests for the unified export module
2. **test_unified_task_manager.py**: Tests for the unified task management module

## Future Recommendations

1. **Further Consolidation**:
   - Consider consolidating the scrapers directory
   - Review utils directory for additional duplication

2. **Code Organization**:
   - Organize code into more logical modules
   - Improve separation of concerns

3. **Documentation**:
   - Update architecture documentation to reflect new structure
   - Add more inline documentation

4. **Testing**:
   - Increase test coverage for core functionality
   - Add integration tests

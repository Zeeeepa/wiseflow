# Dashboard and API Server Integration

This document outlines the changes made to fix the integration between the dashboard and API server components in the Wiseflow project.

## Overview

The dashboard and API server components are critical for user interaction and system control. The integration between these components has been improved to address various issues, including initialization problems, state management inconsistencies, memory leaks, and performance concerns.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dashboard Improvements

- **Fixed Initialization Issues**:
  - Updated `dashboard/__init__.py` to use proper import paths
  - Fixed module imports in `dashboard/main.py`
  - Added proper logging configuration

- **Implemented Consistent State Management**:
  - Standardized on FastAPI for all dashboard components
  - Converted Flask-based resource monitor to FastAPI
  - Implemented proper error handling with custom exception classes

- **Addressed Memory Leaks in Visualization Components**:
  - Added proper resource cleanup in visualization classes
  - Implemented `__del__` methods for resource cleanup
  - Used `weakref` for tracking visualization instances

- **Enhanced Error Handling**:
  - Created custom exception classes for different error types
  - Implemented centralized error handling middleware
  - Added detailed error logging

### 2. API Server Fixes

- **Fixed Code Issues**:
  - Verified and fixed the API server code
  - Added proper input validation with Pydantic validators
  - Improved error handling with detailed error messages

- **Standardized API Endpoint Implementations**:
  - Consistent response formats across all endpoints
  - Proper use of HTTP status codes
  - Comprehensive API documentation

- **Resolved Authentication and Authorization Issues**:
  - Implemented JWT-based authentication
  - Added role-based authorization
  - Improved API key validation

- **Implemented Proper Input Validation**:
  - Added Pydantic validators for all request models
  - Improved error messages for validation failures
  - Added request data sanitization

### 3. Integration Enhancements

- **Standardized Data Format Exchange**:
  - Created shared data models in `core/api/data_models.py`
  - Implemented consistent serialization/deserialization
  - Added data validation for all exchanges

- **Implemented Proper Synchronization Mechanisms**:
  - Added background tasks for asynchronous operations
  - Implemented proper error handling for async operations
  - Added request/response logging

- **Fixed Race Conditions**:
  - Implemented proper locking mechanisms
  - Added transaction support for database operations
  - Improved error handling for concurrent operations

- **Resolved Webhook Integration Issues**:
  - Added webhook signature verification
  - Improved webhook error handling
  - Added retry mechanisms for failed webhook deliveries

### 4. Performance Optimization

- **Optimized Data Loading**:
  - Implemented caching for frequently accessed data
  - Added lazy loading for large datasets
  - Optimized database queries

- **Improved API Endpoint Performance**:
  - Added response caching
  - Implemented connection pooling
  - Optimized request/response serialization

- **Reduced Unnecessary API Calls**:
  - Implemented client-side caching
  - Added conditional requests (If-Modified-Since, ETag)
  - Implemented batch processing for multiple operations

- **Implemented Caching Mechanisms**:
  - Created a flexible caching system in `core/cache/__init__.py`
  - Added cache decorators for functions and methods
  - Implemented automatic cache cleanup

## New Components

- **API Client**: A client for the dashboard to communicate with the API server (`core/api/client.py`)
- **Data Models**: Standardized data models for API and dashboard integration (`core/api/data_models.py`)
- **Authentication Module**: Authentication and authorization utilities (`core/auth/__init__.py`)
- **Caching Module**: Caching mechanisms for improving performance (`core/cache/__init__.py`)
- **Error Handlers**: Error handling middleware and utilities (`dashboard/error_handlers.py`)

## Usage

### API Client

```python
from core.api import ApiClient

async with ApiClient() as client:
    result = await client.process_content(
        content="Sample content",
        focus_point="Extract key information",
        content_type="text"
    )
    print(result)
```

### Caching

```python
from core.cache import cached

@cached(ttl=60)  # Cache for 60 seconds
def get_data(user_id):
    # Expensive operation
    return fetch_data_from_database(user_id)
```

### Error Handling

```python
from dashboard.error_handlers import NotFoundError, ValidationError

def get_item(item_id):
    item = find_item(item_id)
    if not item:
        raise NotFoundError(f"Item not found: {item_id}")
    return item
```

## Testing

To test the integration:

1. Start the API server:
   ```
   python api_server.py
   ```

2. Start the dashboard:
   ```
   python -m dashboard.main
   ```

3. Access the dashboard at http://localhost:8000/dashboard

## Future Improvements

- Implement comprehensive test suite for all components
- Add monitoring and alerting for API and dashboard performance
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- Add support for WebSocket connections for real-time updates
- Improve documentation with OpenAPI specifications

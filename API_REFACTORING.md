# API Server and Dashboard Functionality Refactoring

This document outlines the changes made to address runtime errors and improve the API server and dashboard functionality in the WiseFlow project.

## Overview of Changes

### 1. Consolidated API Functionality

- Created a unified entry point (`main.py`) that combines both API server and dashboard functionality
- Implemented a common API module (`core/api/`) with shared utilities:
  - Standardized response formats
  - Comprehensive error handling
  - Resource management utilities
  - Middleware for logging, performance monitoring, and resource cleanup

### 2. Thread-Safe Webhook Handling

- Replaced the old webhook implementation with a thread-safe version (`core/export/safe_webhook.py`)
- Implemented proper async patterns using asyncio instead of threading
- Added proper resource management and cleanup for background tasks
- Improved error handling and logging in webhook operations

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling

- Created custom exception classes for different error types
- Implemented global exception handlers
- Added comprehensive try/except blocks with proper error logging
- Standardized error response formats across all endpoints

### 4. Improved Resource Management

- Added timeout handling for all external operations
- Implemented proper cleanup of resources in API request handlers
- Added tracking and cleanup of background tasks
- Created utilities for resource management in the common API module

### 5. Standardized Response Formats

- Defined standard response models using Pydantic
- Implemented consistent response formatting across all endpoints
- Added proper validation for request and response data
- Ensured proper HTTP status codes are used

## File Structure Changes

### New Files

- `core/api/common.py` - Common utilities and base classes for API functionality
- `core/api/middleware.py` - API middleware for request/response logging, error handling, and resource management
- `core/api/dependencies.py` - API dependencies for authentication, rate limiting, and resource injection
- `core/api/__init__.py` - Package initialization with exports of common functionality
- `core/export/safe_webhook.py` - Thread-safe webhook implementation
- `main.py` - Unified entry point for the application

### Modified Files

- `api_server.py` - Updated to use the common API module and improved error handling
- `dashboard/main.py` - Updated to use the common API module and standardized response formats
- `dashboard/data_mining_api.py` - Improved error handling and resource management
- `dashboard/search_api.py` - Standardized response formats and improved error handling

## Running the Application

The application can now be run using the unified entry point:

```bash
python main.py
```

Environment variables:

- `HOST` - Host to bind to (default: 0.0.0.0)
- `PORT` - Port to listen on (default: 8000)
- `RELOAD` - Whether to enable auto-reload (default: false)

## API Documentation

The API documentation is available at:

- `/docs` - Swagger UI
- `/redoc` - ReDoc UI

## Future Improvements

1. Add comprehensive unit and integration tests
2. Implement connection pooling for database connections
3. Add monitoring and metrics collection
4. Implement rate limiting for all endpoints
5. Add authentication and authorization for all endpoints

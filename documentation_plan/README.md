# WiseFlow Documentation Improvement Plan

This directory contains the comprehensive plan for improving the WiseFlow project documentation. The goal is to create a more organized, consistent, and user-friendly documentation system that better serves the needs of users, administrators, and developers.

## Contents

- [Documentation Inventory](documentation_inventory.md): An inventory of all existing documentation files, their language, content focus, and status.
- [Documentation Structure](documentation_structure.md): The proposed structure for organizing the documentation by user type and task type.
- [Documentation Standards](documentation_standards.md): Standards for ensuring consistency, clarity, and maintainability across all documentation.
- [Implementation Plan](implementation_plan.md): The phased plan for implementing the improved documentation structure.
- [Sample Documentation](sample_documentation.md): A sample documentation file that follows the proposed standards and structure.

## Key Improvements

The documentation improvement plan addresses the following key areas:

1. **Organization**: Creating a logical structure that makes it easy to find information
2. **Consistency**: Establishing standards for formatting, structure, and content
3. **Completeness**: Filling gaps in the current documentation
4. **User Focus**: Adding more tutorials, examples, and user-oriented content
5. **Multilingual Support**: Improving support for multiple languages
6. **Maintenance**: Establishing processes for keeping documentation up-to-date

## Implementation Approach

The implementation will follow a phased approach:

1. **Phase 1**: Set up the new documentation structure and migrate existing content
2. **Phase 2**: Fill documentation gaps and standardize existing content
3. **Phase 3**: Implement multilingual support
4. **Phase 4**: Establish documentation maintenance processes

## Getting Started

To contribute to the documentation improvement effort:

1. Review the [Documentation Standards](documentation_standards.md) to understand the guidelines
2. Check the [Documentation Inventory](documentation_inventory.md) to see what documentation already exists
3. Refer to the [Implementation Plan](implementation_plan.md) to see what tasks are prioritized
4. Use the [Sample Documentation](sample_documentation.md) as a template for new documentation

## Next Steps

The immediate next steps for the documentation improvement project are:

1. Create the new documentation directory structure
2. Migrate existing documentation to the new structure
3. Begin developing high-priority missing documentation
4. Implement the documentation standards across all files

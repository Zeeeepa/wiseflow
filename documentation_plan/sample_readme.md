## üöÄ Overview

WiseFlow is an intelligent system that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract and analyze information from various sources. It helps you focus on what matters by filtering through massive amounts of information from different sources daily.

What we lack is not information, but the ability to filter out noise from massive information, thereby revealing valuable information.

### üå± See WiseFlow in Action

Watch how WiseFlow helps you save time, filter irrelevant information, and organize key points of interest:

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Multi-Source Information Mining**: Extract information from websites, academic papers, GitHub repositories, YouTube videos, and more
- **Focus Point System**: Define what information matters to you through customizable focus points
- **Plugin Architecture**: Extend functionality with custom connectors, processors, and analyzers
- **Intelligent Analysis**: Use LLMs to analyze and synthesize information from multiple sources
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualize and explore extracted information through an intuitive dashboard
- **Export Capabilities**: Export findings in various formats for further analysis or sharing
- **Automated Scheduling**: Schedule regular information mining tasks
- **Resource Monitoring**: Automatically manage system resources and shut down when tasks are complete

## üî• Online Service

The online trial service of WiseFlow is now open for public testing. No deployment or setup is required, and there is no need to apply for various keys. Just register to use it!

**Online trial address**: [https://www.aiqingbaoguan.com/](https://www.aiqingbaoguan.com/)

During the public testing period, registration will give you 10 free credits (each focus point consumes 1 point per day, regardless of the number of information sources).

> *Note: The online service is built on Alibaba Cloud, and access to websites outside mainland China is restricted. Additionally, the online service currently does not support WeChat official accounts. If your sources primarily consist of these two types, we recommend using the open-source version to deploy yourself.*

## üß† 'Deep Search' VS 'Wide Search'

WiseFlow is positioned as a "wide search" product, in contrast to the currently popular "deep search" approach.

Specifically, "deep search" is oriented towards a specific question, where the LLM autonomously and dynamically plans the search path, continuously explores different pages, and collects enough information to give an answer or produce a report. However, sometimes we don't have a specific question and don't need in-depth exploration. We only need broad information collection (such as industry intelligence collection, background information collection on a subject, customer information collection, etc.). In these cases, breadth is clearly more meaningful. Although "deep search" can also accomplish this task, it's like using a cannon to kill a mosquito ‚Äì inefficient and costly. WiseFlow is a powerful tool specifically designed for this "wide search" scenario.
